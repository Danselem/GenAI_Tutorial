This pattern recognition ability enables machine learning models to make decisions or predictions without explicit, hard-coded instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning has come to dominate the field of AI: it provides the backbone of most modern AI systems, from [forecasting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/forecasting) models to autonomous vehicles to [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) and other [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai) tools.\\n\\nThe central premise of machine learning (ML) is that if you optimize a model’s performance on a dataset of tasks that adequately resemble the real-world problems it will be used for—through a process called [model training](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-training)—the model can make accurate predictions on the *new* data it sees in its ultimate use case.\\n\\nTraining itself is simply a means to an end: *generalization*, the translation of strong performance on training data to useful results in real-world scenarios, is the fundamental goal of machine learning*.* In essence, a trained model is applying patterns it learned from training data to *infer* the correct output for a real-world task: the deployment of an [AI model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model) is therefore called [*AI inference*](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-inference).\\n\\n[Deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning), the subset of machine learning driven by large—or rather, “deep”—[artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks?), has emerged over the past few decades as the state-of-the-art AI model architecture across nearly every domain in which AI is used. In contrast to the explicitly defined algorithms of traditional machine learning, deep learning relies on distributed “networks” of mathematical operations that provide an unparalleled ability to learn the intricate nuances of very complex data. Because deep learning requires very large amounts of data and computational resources, its advent has coincided with the escalated importance [“big data”](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu) and\\xa0[graphics processing units (GPUs).](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu)\\n\\nThe discipline of machine learning is closely intertwined with that of [data science](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-science). In a sense, machine learning can be understood as a collection of algorithms and techniques to automate data analysis and (more importantly) apply learnings from that analysis to the autonomous execution of relevant tasks.\\n\\nThe origin of the term (albeit not the core concept itself) is often attributed to Arthur L. Samuel’s 1959 article in *IBM Journal,* “Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers.” In the paper’s introduction, Samuel neatly articulates machine learning’s ideal outcome: “a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program.”1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Machine learning vs. artificial intelligence\\n\\n\\n\\nThough “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” are often used interchangeably, they are not quite synonymous. In short: *all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning*.\\n\\nIn the popular imagination, “AI” is usually associated with science fiction—typically through depictions of what’s more properly called [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-general-intelligence), like HAL 9000 in *Space Odyssey* or Ava in *Ex Machina*—or, more recently, with [*generative* AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai). But “artificial intelligence” is a catch-all term for any program that can use information to make decisions or predictions without active human involvement.\\n\\nThe most elementary AI system*s* are a series of if-then-else statements, with rules and logic programmed explicitly by a data scientist. \\xa0At the simplest level, even a rudimentary thermostat is a rules-based AI system: when programmed with simple rules likeIF room\\\\_temperature < 67, THEN turn\\\\_on\\\\_heater\\nandIF room\\\\_temperature > 72, THEN turn\\\\_on\\\\_air\\\\_conditioner\\n, the thermostat is capable of autonomous decision-making without further human intervention. At a more complex level, a large and intricate rules-based [decision tree](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees) programmed by medical experts could parse symptoms, circumstances and comorbidities to aid diagnosis or prognosis.2\\n\\nUnlike in expert systems, the logic by which a machine learning model operates isn’t explicitly programmed—it’s *learned* through experience. Consider a program that filters email spam: rules-based AI requires a data scientist to manually devise accurate, universal criteria for spam; machine learning requires only the selection of an appropriate algorithm and an adequate dataset of sample emails. In training, the model is shown sample emails and predicts which are spam; the error of its predictions is calculated, and its algorithm is adjusted to reduce error; this process is repeated until the model is accurate. The newly trained ML model has *implicitly* learned how to identify spam.\\n\\nAs the tasks an AI system is to perform become more complex, rules-based models become increasingly brittle: it’s often impossible to explicitly define *every* pattern and variable a model must consider. Machine learning systems have emerged as the dominant mode of artificial intelligence because implicitly learning patterns from the data itself is inherently more flexible, scalable and accessible.\\n\\n[Ebook\\n\\nHow to choose the right AI foundation model\\n\\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing data sets and employing AI models.](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\\n\\nRelated content\\n[Register for the white paper on AI governance](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52460)\\n\\nHow machine learning works\\n\\n## How machine learning works\\n\\nMachine learning works through mathematical logic. The relevant characteristics (or \"features\") of each data point must therefore be expressed *numerically,* so that the data itself can be fed into a mathematical algorithm that will \"learn\" to map a given input to the desired output.\\n\\nData points in machine learning are usually represented in vector form, in which each element (or dimension) of a data point’s [vector embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-embedding) corresponds to its numerical value for a specific feature. For data modalities that are inherently numerical, such as financial data or geospatial coordinates, this is relatively straightforward. But many data modalities, such as text, images, social media graph data or app user behaviors, are not inherently numerical, and therefore entail less immediately intuitive feature engineering to be expressed in an ML-ready way.\\n\\nThe (often manual) process of choosing which aspects of data to use in machine learning algorithms is called [feature selection](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-selection). [Feature extraction](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-extraction) techniques refine data down to only its most relevant, meaningful dimensions. Both are subsets of\\xa0[feature engineering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-engineering), the\\xa0broader discipline of preprocessing raw data for use in machine learning. One notable distinction of deep learning is that it typically operates on raw data and automates much of the feature engineering—or at least the feature extraction—process. This makes deep learning more scalable, albeit less interpretable, than traditional machine learning.\\n\\n### Machine learning model parameters and optimization\\n\\nFor a practical example, consider a simple [linear regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression) algorithm for predicting home sale prices based on a weighted combination of three variables: square footage, age of house and number of bedrooms. Each house is represented as a vector embedding with 3 dimensions:[square footage, bedrooms, age]\\n. A 30-year-old house with 4 bedrooms and 1900 square feet could be represented as[1900, 4, 30]\\n\\xa0(though for mathematical purposes those numbers might first be scaled, or *normalized*, to a more uniform range).\\n\\nThe algorithm is a straightforward mathematical function:\\xa0Price = (A \\\\* square footage) + (B \\\\* number of rooms) – (C \\\\* Age) + Base Price\\n.\\n\\nHere, A, B and C are the **model parameters**: adjusting them will adjust how heavily the model weighs each variable. The goal of machine learning is to find the optimal values for such model parameters. While most real-world instances of machine learning involve more complex algorithms with a greater number of input variables, the principle remains the same: optimizing the algorithm\\'s adjustable parameters to yield greater accuracy.\\n\\nTypes of machine learning\\n\\n## Types of machine learning\\n\\nAll machine learning methods can be categorized as one of three distinct learning paradigms: *supervised learning*, *unsupervised learning* or *reinforcement learning,* based on the nature of their training objectives and (often but not always) by the type of training data they entail.\\n\\n- [**Supervised learning**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supervised-learning) trains a model to predict the “correct” output for a given input. It applies to tasks that require some degree of accuracy relative to some external “[ground truth,](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ground-truth)” such as classification or regression.\\n- [**Unsupervised learning**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning) trains a model to discern intrinsic patterns, dependencies and correlations in data. Unlike in supervised learning, unsupervised learning tasks don’t involve any external ground truth against which its outputs should be compared.\\n- [**Reinforcement learning (RL)**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning) trains a model to evaluate its environment and take an action that will garner the greatest reward. RL scenarios don’t entail the existence of a singular ground truth, but they do entail the existence of “good” and “bad” (or neutral) actions.\\n\\nThe end-to-end training process for a given model can, and often does, involve hybrid approaches that leverage more than one of these learning paradigms. For instance, unsupervised learning is often used to preprocess data for use in supervised or reinforcement learning. Large language models (LLMs) typically undergo their initial training (*pre-training*) and [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) through variants of supervised learning, followed by more fine-tuning through RL techniques such as [reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rlhf).\\n\\nIn a similar but distinct practice, various [ensemble learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ensemble-learning) methods aggregate the outputs of multiple algorithms.\\n\\n### Supervised machine learning\\n\\n*Supervised learning* algorithms train models for tasks requiring accuracy, such as [classification](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/classification-machine-learning) or regression. Supervised machine learning powers both state-of-the-art deep learning models and a wide array of traditional ML models still widely employed across industries.\\n\\n- **Regression** models predict continuous values, such as price, duration, temperature or size. Examples of traditional regression algorithms include [linear regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression), polynomial regression and [state space models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/state-space-model).\\n- **Classification** models predict discrete values, such as the category (or *class*) a data point belongs to, a binary decision or a specific action to be taken. Examples of traditional classification algorithms include [support vector machines (SVMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine), [Naïve Bayes](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/naive-bayes) and [logistic regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression).\\n- Many supervised ML algorithms can be used for either task. For instance, the output of what’s nominally a regression algorithm can subsequently be used to inform a classification prediction.\\n\\nTo be measured and optimized for accuracy, a model’s outputs must be compared to a *ground truth:* the ideal, “correct” output for any given input. In conventional supervised learning, that ground truth is provided by **labeled data**. An email spam detection model is trained on a dataset of emails that have each been labeled as SPAM or NOT SPAM. An [image segmentation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/image-segmentation) model is trained on images that have been annotated pixel-by-pixel. The goal of supervised learning is to adjust the model’s parameters until its outputs consistently match the ground truth provided by those labels.\\n\\nEssential to supervised learning is the use of a [loss function](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function) that measures the divergence (“loss”) between the model’s output and the ground truth across a batch of training inputs. The objective of supervised learning is defined mathematically as *minimizing the output of a loss function.* Once loss has been computed, various optimization algorithms—most of which involve calculating the [derivative](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation#Key+mathematical+concepts+for+backpropagation)(s) of the loss function—are used to identify parameter adjustments that will reduce loss.\\n\\nBecause this process traditionally requires a human in the loop to provide ground truth in the form of data annotations, it’s called “supervised” learning. As such, the use of labeled data was historically considered the definitive characteristic of supervised learning. But on the most fundamental level, the hallmark of supervised learning is the existence of some ground truth and the training objective of minimizing the output of loss function that measures divergence from it.\\n\\nTo accommodate a more versatile notion of supervised learning, modern ML terminology uses “supervision” or “supervisory signals” to refer generically to any source of ground truth.\\n\\n#### Self-supervised learning\\n\\nLabeling data can become prohibitively costly and time-consuming for complex tasks and large datasets. [Self-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-supervised-learning) entails training on tasks in which a supervisory signal is obtained directly from *unlabeled* data—hence “self” supervised.\\n\\nFor instance, [autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder)\\xa0are trained to compress (or\\xa0*encode*) input data, then reconstruct (or\\xa0*decode*) the original input using that compressed representation. Their training objective is to minimize\\xa0*reconstruction error*, using the original input itself as ground truth. Self-supervised learning is also the primary training method for LLMs: models are provided text samples with certain words hidden or masked and tasked with predicting the missing words.\\n\\nSelf-supervised learning is frequently associated with [transfer learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transfer-learning?), as it can provide [foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/foundation-models) with broad capabilities that will then be [fine-tuned](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) for more specific tasks.\\n\\n#### Semi-supervised learning\\n\\nWhereas self-supervised learning is essentially supervised learning on unlabeled data, [semi-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semi-supervised-learning) methods use both labeled data *and* unlabeled data. Broadly speaking, semi-supervised learning comprises techniques that use information from the available labeled data to make assumptions about the unlabeled data points so that the latter can be incorporated into supervised learning workflows.\\n\\n### Unsupervised machine learning\\n\\nUnsupervised machine learning algorithms discern intrinsic patterns in unlabeled data, such as similarities, correlations or potential groupings. They’re most useful in scenarios where such patterns aren’t necessarily apparent to human observers. Because unsupervised learning doesn’t assume the preexistence of a known “correct” output, they don’t require supervisory signals or conventional loss functions—hence “unsupervised.”\\n\\nMost unsupervised learning methods perform one of the following functions:\\n\\n- [**Clustering**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/clustering)algorithms partition unlabeled data points into “clusters,” or groupings, based on their proximity or similarity to one another. They’re typically used for tasks like market segmentation or fraud detection. Prominent clustering algorithms include K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and density-based methods such as DBSCAN.\\n- **Association** algorithms discern correlations, such as between a particular action and certain conditions. For instance, e-commerce businesses such as Amazon use unsupervised [association](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/nodes/associationrules.html?context=cpdaas) models to power recommendation engines.\\n- [**Dimensionality reduction**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dimensionality-reduction)algorithms reduce the complexity of data points by representing them with a smaller number of features—that is, in fewer dimensions—while [preserving their meaningful characteristics](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latent-space). They’re often used for preprocessing data, as well as for tasks such as data compression or data visualization. Prominent dimensionality reduction algorithms include [autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder), [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/principal-component-analysis), [linear discriminant analysis (LDA)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-discriminant-analysis) and [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)\\n\\nAs their name suggests, unsupervised learning algorithms can be broadly understood as somewhat “optimizing themselves.” For example, [this animation](https://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/6.html) demonstrates how a k-means clustering algorithm iteratively optimizes the centroid of each cluster on its own. The challenge of training unsupervised models therefore focuses on effective data preprocessing and properly [tuning hyperparameters](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hyperparameter-tuning) that influence the learning process but are not themselves learnable, such as the [learning rate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/learning-rate) or number of clusters.\\n\\n### Reinforcement learning (RL)\\n\\nWhereas supervised learning trains models by optimizing them to match ideal exemplars and unsupervised learning algorithms fit themselves to a dataset, [reinforcement learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning) models are trained holistically through trial and error. They’re used prominently in robotics, video games, [reasoning models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reasoning-model) and other use cases in which the space of possible solutions and approaches are particularly large, open-ended or difficult to define. In RL literature, an AI system is often referred to as an “agent.”\\n\\nRather than the independent pairs of input-output data used in supervised learning, reinforcement learning (RL) operates on interdependent state-action-reward data tuples. Instead of minimizing error, the objective of reinforcement learning is optimizing parameters to maximize reward.\\n\\nA mathematical framework for reinforcement learning is built primarily on the following components:\\n\\n- The **state space** contains all available information relevant to decisions that the model might make. The state typically changes with each action that the model takes.\\n- The **action space** contains all the decisions that the model is permitted to make at a moment. In a board game, for instance, the action space comprises all legal moves available at a given time. In text generation, the action space comprises the entire “vocabulary” of tokens available to an LLM.\\n- The **reward signal** is the feedback—positive or negative, typically expressed as a scalar value—provided to the agent as a result of each action. The value of the reward signal could be determined by explicit rules, by a *reward function,* or by a separately trained *reward model.*\\n- A **policy** is the “thought process” that drives an RL agent’s behavior. Mathematically speaking, a policy (\\xa0π\\xa0) is a function that takes a state (\\xa0s\\xa0) as input and returns an action (\\xa0a\\xa0): \\xa0\\xa0π(s)→a\\xa0.\\n\\nIn *policy-based* methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO), the model learns a policy directly. In *value-based* methods like Q-learning, the agent learns a *value function* that computes a score for how “good” each state is, then chooses actions that lead to higher-value states. Consider a maze: a policy-based agent might learn “*at this corner, turn left*,” while a value-based agent learns a score for each position and simply moves to an adjacent position with a better score. Hybrid approaches, such as actor-critic methods, learn a value function that’s then used to optimize a policy.\\n\\nIn deep reinforcement learning, the policy is represented as a neural network.\\n\\nDeep learning\\n\\n## Deep learning\\n\\n[Deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning) employs [artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks)\\nwith many layers—hence “deep”—rather than the explicitly designed\\nalgorithms of traditional machine learning. Though neural networks were\\nintroduced early in the history of machine learning, it wasn’t until the\\nlate 2000s and early 2010s, enabled in part by advancements in [GPUs](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu), that they became dominant in most subfields of AI.\\n\\nLoosely inspired by the human brain, neural networks comprise interconnected layers of “neurons” (or *nodes*),\\neach of which performs its own mathematical operation (called an\\n“activation function”). The output of each node’s activation function\\nserves as input to each of the nodes of the following layer and so on\\nuntil the final layer, where the network’s final output is computed.\\nCrucially, the activation functions performed at each node are *nonlinear*, enabling neural networks to model complex patterns and dependencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach connection between two neurons is assigned a unique *weight*: a multiplier that increases or decreases one neuron’s contribution to a neuron in the following layer. These weights, along with *bias* terms between layers, are the parameters to be optimized through machine learning.\\n\\nThe [**backpropagation**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation)algorithm enables the computation of how *each individual node* contributes to the overall output of the loss function, allowing even millions or billions of model weights to be individually optimized through [gradient descent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent) algorithms. Because of the volume and granularity of updates required to achieve optimal results, deep learning requires very large amounts of data and computational resources compared to traditional ML.  \\n  \\nThat distributed structure affords deep learning models their incredible power and versatility. Imagine training data as data points scattered on a 2-dimensional graph. Essentially, traditional machine learning aims to find a single curve that runs through every one of those data points; deep learning pieces together an arbitrary number of smaller, individually adjustable lines to form the desired shape. Neural networks are *universal approximators*: it has been theoretically proven that for any function, there exists [a neural network arrangement that can reproduce it](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html).\\n\\nHaving said that, just because something is *theoretically* possible doesn’t mean it’s practically achievable through existing training methods. For many years, adequate performance on certain tasks remained out of reach even for deep learning models—but over time, modifications to the standard neural network architecture have unlocked new capabilities for ML models.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\\n\\n\\n\\n[Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/convolutional-neural-networks) add *convolutional layers* to neural networks. In mathematics, a convolution is an operation where one function modifies (or *convolves*) the shape of another. In CNNs, convolutional layers are used to extract important features from data by [applying weighted “filters”.](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks/) CNNs are primarily associated with computer vision models and image data, but have a number of other important use cases.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)\\n\\n\\n\\n[Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/recurrent-neural-networks) are designed to work on sequential data. Whereas conventional feedforward neural networks map a single input to a single output, RNNs map a *sequence* of inputs to an output by operating in a recurrent loop in which the output for a given step in the input sequence serves as input to the computation for the following step. In effect this creates an internal “memory,” called the *hidden state*, that allows RNNs to understand context and order.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Transformers\\n\\n\\n\\n[Transformer models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model), first introduced in 2017, are largely responsible for the advent of LLMs and other pillars of generative AI, achieving state-of-the-art results across most subdomains of machine learning. Like RNNs, transformers are ostensibly designed for sequential data, but clever workarounds have enabled most data modalities to be processed by transformers. The unique strength of transformer models comes from their innovative [attention mechanism](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism), which enables the models to selectively focus on the parts of the input data most relevant at a specific moment in a sequence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Mamba models\\n\\n\\n\\n[Mamba models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model) are a relatively new neural network architecture, first introduced in 2023, based on a unique variation of [state space models (SSMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/state-space-model). Like transformers, Mamba models provide an innovative means of selectively prioritizing the most relevant information at a given moment. Mamba has recently emerged as a rival to the transformer architecture, particularly for LLMs.\\n\\nMachine learning use cases\\n\\n## Machine learning use cases\\n\\nMost applications of machine learning fall into one or more of the following categories, which are defined primarily by their use cases and the data modalities they operate upon.\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nComputer vision is the subdomain of AI concerned with image data, video data other data modalities that require a model or machine to “see,” from healthcare diagnostics to facial recognition to self-driving cars. Notable subfields of computer vision include image classification, [object detection](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/object-detection), [image segmentation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/image-segmentation) and [optical character recognition (OCR](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/optical-character-recognition)).\\n\\n### Natural language processing (NLP)\\n\\nThe field of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) spans a diverse array of tasks concerning text, speech and other language data. Notable subdomains of NLP include [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots), [speech recognition](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/speech-recognition), [language translation,](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-translation) [sentiment analysis](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/sentiment-analysis), [text generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-generation), [summarization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization) and [AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent). In modern NLP, large language models continue to advance the state of the art at an unprecedented pace.\\n\\n### Time series analysis\\n\\n[Time series models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/time-series-model) are applied anomaly detection, market analysis and related pattern recognition or prediction tasks. They use machine learning on historical data for a variety of forecasting use cases.\\n\\n### Image generation\\n\\n[Diffusion models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/diffusion-models), [variational autoencoders (VAEs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/variational-autoencoder) and [generative adversarial networks (GANs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-adversarial-networks) can be used to generate original images that apply pixel patterns learned from training data.\\n\\nMachine learning operations (MLOps)\\n\\n## Machine learning operations (MLOps)\\n\\n[Machine learning operations (MLOps)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mlops) is a set of practices for implementing an assembly line approach to building, deploying and maintaining machine learning models.\\n\\nCareful curation and preprocessing of training data, as well as appropriate [model selection](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-selection), are crucial steps in the MLOps pipeline. Thoughtful post-training validation, from the design of benchmark datasets to the prioritization of particular performance [metrics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=models-evaluation-metrics), is necessary to ensure that a model generalizes well (and isn’t just [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/overfitting) the training data).\\n\\nFollowing deployment, models must be monitored for [model drift](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-drift), inference efficiency issues and other adverse developments. A well-defined practice of [model governance](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-governance) is essential to continued efficacy, especially in regulated or fast-changing industries.\\n\\nMachine learning libraries\\n\\n## Machine learning libraries\\n\\nA number of open source tools, libraries and frameworks exist for building, training and testing machine learning projects. While such libraries offer an array of pre-configured modules and abstractions to streamline the process of building ML-based models and workflows, practitioners will need to familiarize themselves with commonly used programming languages—particularly [Python](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/python/)—to make full use of them.\\n\\nProminent open source libraries, particularly for building deep learning models, include [PyTorch](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pytorch), [TensorFlow](https://developer.ibm.com/components/tensorflow/), Keras and the Hugging Face Transformers library.\\n\\nNotable open source [machine learning libraries](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning-libraries) and toolkits focused on traditional ML include Pandas, [Scikit-learn](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/scikit-learn), [XGBoost](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/xgboost), [Matplotlib](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/55f7f605960d9a4d578aeeaa2b62bdea), SciPy and NumPy among many others.\\n\\nIBM itself maintains and updates a significant library of [tutorials](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/machine-learning/tutorials/) for beginners and advanced ML practitioners alike.\\n\\nRelated products and solutions\\n\\n## Related products and solutions\\n\\nAI consulting services\\n\\n\\nReimagine how you work with\\xa0AI: Our diverse, global team of more than 20,000 AI\\xa0experts can help you quickly and confidently\\xa0design and scale AI and automation across your\\xa0business, working across our own IBM\\xa0watsonx™\\xa0technology\\xa0and an open ecosystem of partners to deliver any\\xa0AI model, on any cloud, guided by ethics and trust.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore IBM AI consulting services\\n\\nAI solutions\\n\\n\\nOperationalize AI across your business to deliver benefits quickly and ethically.

      "Machine learning has come to dominate the field of AI: it provides the backbone of most modern AI systems, from [forecasting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/forecasting) models to autonomous vehicles to [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) and other [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai) tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central premise of machine learning (ML) is that if you optimize a model’s performance on a dataset of tasks that adequately resemble the real-world problems it will be used for—through a process called [model training](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-training)—the model can make accurate predictions on the *new* data it sees in its ultimate use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Training itself is simply a means to an end: *generalization*, the translation of strong performance on training data to useful results in real-world scenarios, is the fundamental goal of machine learning*.* In essence, a trained model is applying patterns it learned from training data to *infer* the correct output for a real-world task: the deployment of an [AI model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model) is therefore called [*AI inference*](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-inference).\n",

      "[Deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning), the subset of machine learning driven by large—or rather, “deep”—[artificial neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks?), has emerged over the past few decades as the state-of-the-art AI model architecture across nearly every domain in which AI is used. In contrast to the explicitly defined algorithms of traditional machine learning, deep learning relies on distributed “networks” of mathematical operations that provide an unparalleled ability to learn the intricate nuances of very complex data. Because deep learning requires very large amounts of data and computational resources, its advent has coincided with the escalated importance [“big data”](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu) and [graphics processing units (GPUs).](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu)\n",

      "\n",
      "In the popular imagination, “AI” is usually associated with science fiction—typically through depictions of what’s more properly called [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-general-intelligence), like HAL 9000 in *Space Odyssey* or Ava in *Ex Machina*—or, more recently, with [*generative* AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai). But “artificial intelligence” is a catch-all term for any program that can use information to make decisions or predictions without active human involvement.\n",

      "The most elementary AI system*s* are a series of if-then-else statements, with rules and logic programmed explicitly by a data scientist.  At the simplest level, even a rudimentary thermostat is a rules-based AI system: when programmed with simple rules likeIF room\\_temperature < 67, THEN turn\\_on\\_heater\n",

      "\n",
      "Unlike in expert systems, the logic by which a machine learning model operates isn’t explicitly programmed—it’s *learned* through experience.

      "\n",
      "Machine learning works through mathematical logic. The relevant characteristics (or \"features\") of each data point must therefore be expressed *numerically,* so that the data itself can be fed into a mathematical algorithm that will \"learn\" to map a given input to the desired output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data points in machine learning are usually represented in vector form, in which each element (or dimension) of a data point’s [vector embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-embedding) corresponds to its numerical value for a specific feature. For data modalities that are inherently numerical, such as financial data or geospatial coordinates, this is relatively straightforward. But many data modalities, such as text, images, social media graph data or app user behaviors, are not inherently numerical, and therefore entail less immediately intuitive feature engineering to be expressed in an ML-ready way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The (often manual) process of choosing which aspects of data to use in machine learning algorithms is called [feature selection](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-selection). [Feature extraction](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-extraction) techniques refine data down to only its most relevant, meaningful dimensions. Both are subsets of [feature engineering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/feature-engineering), the broader discipline of preprocessing raw data for use in machine learning. One notable distinction of deep learning is that it typically operates on raw data and automates much of the feature engineering—or at least the feature extraction—process. This makes deep learning more scalable, albeit less interpretable, than traditional machine learning.\n",

While most real-world instances of machine learning involve more complex algorithms with a greater number of input variables, the principle remains the same: optimizing the algorithm's adjustable parameters to yield greater accuracy.\n",

      "Types of machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "## Types of machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "All machine learning methods can be categorized as one of three distinct learning paradigms: *supervised learning*, *unsupervised learning* or *reinforcement learning,* based on the nature of their training objectives and (often but not always) by the type of training data they entail.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [**Supervised learning**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supervised-learning) trains a model to predict the “correct” output for a given input. It applies to tasks that require some degree of accuracy relative to some external “[ground truth,](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ground-truth)” such as classification or regression.\n",
      "- [**Unsupervised learning**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning) trains a model to discern intrinsic patterns, dependencies and correlations in data. Unlike in supervised learning, unsupervised learning tasks don’t involve any external ground truth against which its outputs should be compared.\n",
      "- [**Reinforcement learning (RL)**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning) trains a model to evaluate its environment and take an action that will garner the greatest reward. RL scenarios don’t entail the existence of a singular ground truth, but they do entail the existence of “good” and “bad” (or neutral) actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-to-end training process for a given model can, and often does, involve hybrid approaches that leverage more than one of these learning paradigms. For instance, unsupervised learning is often used to preprocess data for use in supervised or reinforcement learning. Large language models (LLMs) typically undergo their initial training (*pre-training*) and [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) through variants of supervised learning, followed by more fine-tuning through RL techniques such as [reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rlhf).\n",
      "\n",
      "In a similar but distinct practice, various [ensemble learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ensemble-learning) methods aggregate the outputs of multiple algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Supervised machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "*Supervised learning* algorithms train models for tasks requiring accuracy, such as [classification](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/classification-machine-learning) or regression. Supervised machine learning powers both state-of-the-art deep learning models and a wide array of traditional ML models still widely employed across industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Regression** models predict continuous values, such as price, duration, temperature or size. Examples of traditional regression algorithms include [linear regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression), polynomial regression and [state space models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/state-space-model).\n",
      "- **Classification** models predict discrete values, such as the category (or *class*) a data point belongs to, a binary decision or a specific action to be taken. Examples of traditional classification algorithms include [support vector machines (SVMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine), [Naïve Bayes](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/naive-bayes) and [logistic regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression).\n",
      "- Many supervised ML algorithms can be used for either task. For instance, the output of what’s nominally a regression algorithm can subsequently be used to inform a classification prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be measured and optimized for accuracy, a model’s outputs must be compared to a *ground truth:* the ideal, “correct” output for any given input. In conventional supervised learning, that ground truth is provided by **labeled data**. An email spam detection model is trained on a dataset of emails that have each been labeled as SPAM or NOT SPAM. An [image segmentation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/image-segmentation) model is trained on images that have been annotated pixel-by-pixel. The goal of supervised learning is to adjust the model’s parameters until its outputs consistently match the ground truth provided by those labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essential to supervised learning is the use of a [loss function](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function) that measures the divergence (“loss”) between the model’s output and the ground truth across a batch of training inputs. The objective of supervised learning is defined mathematically as *minimizing the output of a loss function.* Once loss has been computed, various optimization algorithms—most of which involve calculating the [derivative](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation#Key+mathematical+concepts+for+backpropagation)(s) of the loss function—are used to identify parameter adjustments that will reduce loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because this process traditionally requires a human in the loop to provide ground truth in the form of data annotations, it’s called “supervised” learning. As such, the use of labeled data was historically considered the definitive characteristic of supervised learning. But on the most fundamental level, the hallmark of supervised learning is the existence of some ground truth and the training objective of minimizing the output of loss function that measures divergence from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accommodate a more versatile notion of supervised learning, modern ML terminology uses “supervision” or “supervisory signals” to refer generically to any source of ground truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Self-supervised learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Labeling data can become prohibitively costly and time-consuming for complex tasks and large datasets. [Self-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-supervised-learning) entails training on tasks in which a supervisory signal is obtained directly from *unlabeled* data—hence “self” supervised.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, [autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder) are trained to compress (or *encode*) input data, then reconstruct (or *decode*) the original input using that compressed representation. Their training objective is to minimize *reconstruction error*, using the original input itself as ground truth. Self-supervised learning is also the primary training method for LLMs: models are provided text samples with certain words hidden or masked and tasked with predicting the missing words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-supervised learning is frequently associated with [transfer learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transfer-learning?), as it can provide [foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/foundation-models) with broad capabilities that will then be [fine-tuned](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) for more specific tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Semi-supervised learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas self-supervised learning is essentially supervised learning on unlabeled data, [semi-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semi-supervised-learning) methods use both labeled data *and* unlabeled data. Broadly speaking, semi-supervised learning comprises techniques that use information from the available labeled data to make assumptions about the unlabeled data points so that the latter can be incorporated into supervised learning workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unsupervised machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsupervised machine learning algorithms discern intrinsic patterns in unlabeled data, such as similarities, correlations or potential groupings. They’re most useful in scenarios where such patterns aren’t necessarily apparent to human observers. Because unsupervised learning doesn’t assume the preexistence of a known “correct” output, they don’t require supervisory signals or conventional loss functions—hence “unsupervised.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most unsupervised learning methods perform one of the following functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- [**Clustering**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/clustering)algorithms partition unlabeled data points into “clusters,” or groupings, based on their proximity or similarity to one another. They’re typically used for tasks like market segmentation or fraud detection. Prominent clustering algorithms include K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and density-based methods such as DBSCAN.\n",
      "- **Association** algorithms discern correlations, such as between a particular action and certain conditions. For instance, e-commerce businesses such as Amazon use unsupervised [association](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/nodes/associationrules.html?context=cpdaas) models to power recommendation engines.\n",
      "- [**Dimensionality reduction**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dimensionality-reduction)algorithms reduce the complexity of data points by representing them with a smaller number of features—that is, in fewer dimensions—while [preserving their meaningful characteristics](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latent-space). They’re often used for preprocessing data, as well as for tasks such as data compression or data visualization. Prominent dimensionality reduction algorithms include [autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder), [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/principal-component-analysis), [linear discriminant analysis (LDA)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-discriminant-analysis) and [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)\n",
      "\n",
      "As their name suggests, unsupervised learning algorithms can be broadly understood as somewhat “optimizing themselves.” For example, [this animation](https://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/6.html) demonstrates how a k-means clustering algorithm iteratively optimizes the centroid of each cluster on its own. The challenge of training unsupervised models therefore focuses on effective data preprocessing and properly [tuning hyperparameters](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hyperparameter-tuning) that influence the learning process but are not themselves learnable, such as the [learning rate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/learning-rate) or number of clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reinforcement learning (RL)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas supervised learning trains models by optimizing them to match ideal exemplars and unsupervised learning algorithms fit themselves to a dataset, [reinforcement learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning) models are trained holistically through trial and error. They’re used prominently in robotics, video games, [reasoning models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reasoning-model) and other use cases in which the space of possible solutions and approaches are particularly large, open-ended or difficult to define. In RL literature, an AI system is often referred to as an “agent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than the independent pairs of input-output data used in supervised learning, reinforcement learning (RL) operates on interdependent state-action-reward data tuples. Instead of minimizing error, the objective of reinforcement learning is optimizing parameters to maximize reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mathematical framework for reinforcement learning is built primarily on the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The **state space** contains all available information relevant to decisions that the model might make. The state typically changes with each action that the model takes.\n",
      "- The **action space** contains all the decisions that the model is permitted to make at a moment. In a board game, for instance, the action space comprises all legal moves available at a given time. In text generation, the action space comprises the entire “vocabulary” of tokens available to an LLM.\n",
      "- The **reward signal** is the feedback—positive or negative, typically expressed as a scalar value—provided to the agent as a result of each action. The value of the reward signal could be determined by explicit rules, by a *reward function,* or by a separately trained *reward model.*\n",
      "- A **policy** is the “thought process” that drives an RL agent’s behavior. Mathematically speaking, a policy ( π ) is a function that takes a state ( s ) as input and returns an action ( a ):   π(s)→a .\n",
      "\n",
      "In *policy-based* methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO), the model learns a policy directly. In *value-based* methods like Q-learning, the agent learns a *value function* that computes a score for how “good” each state is, then chooses actions that lead to higher-value states. Consider a maze: a policy-based agent might learn “*at this corner, turn left*,” while a value-based agent learns a score for each position and simply moves to an adjacent position with a better score. Hybrid approaches, such as actor-critic methods, learn a value function that’s then used to optimize a policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In deep reinforcement learning, the policy is represented as a neural network.\n",

      "\n",
      "The [**backpropagation**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation)algorithm enables the computation of how *each individual node* contributes to the overall output of the loss function, allowing even millions or billions of model weights to be individually optimized through [gradient descent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent) algorithms. Because of the volume and granularity of updates required to achieve optimal results, deep learning requires very large amounts of data and computational resources compared to traditional ML.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "That distributed structure affords deep learning models their incredible power and versatility. Imagine training data as data points scattered on a 2-dimensional graph. Essentially, traditional machine learning aims to find a single curve that runs through every one of those data points; deep learning pieces together an arbitrary number of smaller, individually adjustable lines to form the desired shape.

[About Us](https://science.uct.ac.za/about-us/deans-welcome)\\n\\n# Dean\\'s Welcome\\n\\nWelcome to the Faculty of Science website, which we hope you will find informative and easy to use, whether as a first-time student seeking information about undergraduate degrees, as a student enquiring about postgraduate study, as a postdoctoral researcher looking for research opportunities, or as an established researcher seeking opportunities to collaborate.\\n\\nThe Faculty prides itself on its strong teaching programmes, at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, and on the strength of its\\xa0research enterprise. With well developed international links with researchers across the world, the Faculty is a major contributor to cutting-edge, globally relevant research. Our goal is to be internationally recognised as a leading, research-intensive Faculty and the top Science Faculty on the African continent, producing research that is globally competitive and locally relevant.\\n\\nAt the same time, we strive to be a major contributor to educating scientists of the future through our many and varied undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Our degrees are internationally recognised, thus ensuring that graduates are globally mobile.\\xa0The majority of our staff have strong international research profiles and have active research programmes covering a wide range of science disciplines that involve collaborations with leading researchers across the world.\\xa0\\n\\nWe are proud of our diverse student and staff bodies, with more than a third of our students and staff being international. We believe that our learning and research environments are considerably enhanced by the rich exchange of ideas and experiences that transpire from this diversity. Links with other African universities and leading academic institutions around the world are strong, and there is a regular stream of world-class researchers and teachers visiting the Faculty on an annual basis, to the benefit of students and staff alike.\\n\\nThe Faculty is equipped with a vast range of infrastructure and state-of-the-art equipment linked to ongoing research projects, enabling prospective students and researchers the opportunity to explore many different areas of specialisation. Details of such opportunities, in both research and teaching, can be found elsewhere on the website.\\n\\nShould you have any queries, please **[contact us](/sci/contact)**.\\n\\n**Professor Hussein Suleman  \\nDean: Faculty of Science**\\n\\n![Hussein Suleman](/sites/default/files/inline-images/DSCN6614.JPG)\\n\\n#### STUDY SCIENCE\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-05.png)](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)\\n\\n**[Archaeology](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-06.png)](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)\\n\\n**[Astronomy](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-07.png)](/sci/departments/study-biology)\\n\\n**[Biological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-08.png)](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)\\n\\n**[Chemistry](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-09.png)](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)\\n\\n**[Computer Science](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-12.png)](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)\\n\\n**[Environmental and Geographical Science](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-10.png)](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)\\n\\n**[Geological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-11.png)](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)\\n\\n**[Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-13.png)](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)\\n\\n**[Molecular and Cell Biology](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-14.png)](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)\\n\\n**[Oceanography](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-15.png)](/sci/departments/study-physics)\\n\\n**[Physics](/sci/departments/study-physics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-16.png)](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)\\n\\n**[Statistical Sciences](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

[About Us](/about-us/deans-welcome)\\n\\n# Faculty Overview\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/zoo10-dalebrook.jpg)\\n\\nS -33.955533, E 18.460527 - These mark the geographical coordinates that pin point the Chris Hani Building, administrative home to the 12 departments that constitute the Faculty of Science.\\n\\nThe Faculty of Science is home to approximately 2 600 students, of which some 36% are postgraduate research students registered in the 12 academic departments – Archaeology, Astronomy, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental & Geographical Science, Geological Sciences, Mathematics & Applied Mathematics, Molecular & Cell Biology, Oceanography, Physics and Statistical Sciences. All departments are located on Upper Campus. There are about 185 academic staff and some 160 support staff who provide for our undergraduate and postgraduate students.\\n\\nUndergraduate teaching is a cornerstone of our activities and the Faculty offers 20\\xa0different majors, with possibilities to co-major in subjects located in other Faculties. Our majors are loosely organised into three clusters – those in the biology, earth and environmental sciences, those in the chemical and molecular sciences, and those in the numerical and physical sciences. Details of the majors we offer and their home departments can be found [here](/sci/undergrad/overview/courses-majors-rules). Our Bachelor of Science degree leads naturally on to a number of different Honours degrees that relate to the undergraduate major(s) offered by the various departments. Details of Honours degrees offered can be found [here](/sci/postgrad/overview/degrees).\\n\\nThe Faculty of Science prides itself on the high regard in which it is held by the international academic community, reflected in part by international world university and subject rankings. According to the latest QS rankings, the Science Faculty at UCT places in the band 51-100 top universities in the Earth and Marine Sciences and in the band 101-150 in the Biological and Environmental Sciences. In part, the national and international prominence of our staff is captured in the high number of researchers rated by the National Research Foundation (NRF) system as having leading or prominent international standing (18\\xa0A-rated, 64\\xa0B-rated, 60\\xa0C-rated and 7\\xa0P-rated). Much of this international recognition comes from the strong research programmes run by our Faculty staff, in collaboration with international colleagues, the rigorous doctoral programmes offered by the Faculty, and through the resultant research output. Research emanating from the Faculty is published by a mixture of 185 permanent academic staff, over 80 Honorary Research Associates, ~400 doctoral students, ~140 postdoctoral fellows, 14\\xa0South African Research Chairs, 14\\xa0Senior Scholars, and international collaborators from across the world. An important component of our research takes place through 16 formal university accredited intra- and inter-disciplinary research groupings, and an NRF Centre of Excellence, details of which can be found [here](/sci/research/formal-research-groupings).\\n\\n**University Research Fellows in the Faculty**\\n\\nA Fellowship of the University of Cape Town is the highest honour the university accords a member of the academic staff in recognition of research achievement.

At the Department of Archaeology at UCT, we study cultural, biological, and fossil records to answer how humans and our environment have evolved.  \\n  \\nOur researchers are especially interested in the dynamics of a past when the climate was changing dramatically, and when most of the modern flora and fauna, including our own species, Homo sapiens, evolved.  \\n  \\nWith inclusive research teams and access to leading facilities, studies at the Department of Archaeology aim to answer how we became who we are today.\\n\\n[Our research](/department-archaeology/research-department-archaeology \"Research\")\\n\\n## \\n\\n![student at work](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/435/images/homepage_institutes1.jpg)\\n\\n### Access excellence in Archaeology\\n\\nOur students access African-led research, training, and outreach.

EGS\\n\\nThe Environmental and Geographical Science department is a dynamic and thriving academic community that focuses on the most pressing challenges of our time, from environmental change to social justice. We are committed to high standards of research, covering a broad array of subjects including the Anthropocene era, urban and rural dynamics, geopolitics, global development, earth systems, sustainability and climate change. Engaging with complex contemporary issues that are of relevance to society necessitates that the questions we ask draw upon philosophies and methods that integrate across the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities. Our focus on complexity is supported through collaborations and engagements with a range of knowledge bearers beyond the university, including community groups, and the public and private sectors. The curriculum is enhanced through research-led teaching, using theory, case studies, practical and field-based approaches. We cover a range of conceptual debates that critically engage relationships in place and across space and time in order to understand social, human, physical and biophysical interactions shaping contemporary challenges facing us at different scales - locally, nationally, across the continent and globally.

Formally established in 1918 by UCT’s founding act, today it’s a sizable faculty consisting of 12 departments and multiple research units whose teaching and research is internationally acknowledged for excellence.\\n\\n**Academic Departments:**\\n\\n[Archaeology](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/archaeology) [Astronomy](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/astronomy) [Biological Sciences](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/biological-sciences) [Chemistry](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/chemistry) [Environmental & Geographical Science](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/environmental-geographical-science) [Geological Sciences](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/geological-sciences)\\n\\n[Mathematics & Applied Mathematics](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/mathematics-applied-mathematics) [Molecular & Cell Biology](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/molecular-cell-biology) [Oceanography](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/oceanography) [Physics](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/physics) [School of IT](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/school-it-incorporating-computer-science-and-information-systems) [Statistical Sciences](https://science.uct.ac.za/departments/statistical-sciences)\\n\\n**Areas of Research Focus:**\\n\\nAfrican Climate and Development  \\nAfrica occupies a critical global position for the study of large- scale climate and environmental processes. These systems affect much on the African continent – its changing climate, its biota and human development.\\n\\nBiodiversity and the Greater Cape Floristic Region  \\nThe Greater Cape Floristic Region includes the fynbos biome – which competes with the Amazon rainforest in terms of diversity – and the world’s greatest arid hotspot, the Succulent Karoo. The region also includes high levels of animal biodiversity and offers important perspectives on landscape development, climate change and Earth history.\\n\\nChemistry and Biology for Health in Africa  \\nThe major global medical need of the 21st century will be in Africa. The clinical expertise at UCT, coupled with the wide ethnic diversity of patients, makes the Western Cape a good environment to conduct translational science and medicinal research that is relevant to Africa.\\n\\nMarine Biology and the Southern Oceans  \\nThe marine environments around South Africa are amongst the most diverse in the world, and the interplay between the two major currents – the Benguela and the Agulhas – and the three major oceans are central to African climate variability.\\n\\nSouthern Skies and Evolving Universe  \\nEasy access to the Southern African Large Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array makes the faculty a global research leader in the study of the southern skies and the early universe.\\n\\nHuman Evolution and the African Quaternary  \\nOur location provides faculty researchers with access to unique archaeological sites and Southern-Hemisphere climatic and environmental records over the time span of the Quaternary, which allows a better understanding of this important time period in Africa.\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

[Home](/)\\n\\n# Archaeology\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/archaeology.jpg)\\n\\nThe Department of Archaeology exploits its location in a region rich in archaeological heritage, with evidence of human occupation for the last half million years. Specific research interests include issues related to human evolution,\\xa0the emergence of modern humans,\\xa0and the history of hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, and farming communities in southern Africa, as well as the archaeology of more recent colonial settlement. In addition, the department is home to archaeometric and materials research, focusing on paleoanthropology, past environments, early human diets, and materials analysis.\\xa0  \\n  \\nIn order to understand and interpret this heritage, the faculty and students in the department interact widely with a number of other departments (Biological Sciences, Environmental & Geographical Science, History, Geological Sciences and Human Biology) and institutions (such as the Iziko Museums of Cape Town).\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n[**http://www.archaeology.uct.ac.za**](http://www.archaeology.uct.ac.za)\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

It is the only dedicated university-based astronomy group in the country. Since its launch it has strong ties - and also joint positions - with the South African Astronomical Observatory (**[www.saao.ac.za](http://www.saao.ac.za)**) making regular use of the telescopes, including the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in Sutherland. In recent years equally strong interactions have been established by\\xa0growing the radio group with the South African SKA Office due to its strong involvement (and lead) in four of the ten MeerKAT large survey projects . The department specialises in high speed photometry and spectroscopy of variable stars, in long period variable stars and Galactic Structure, neutral \\xa0hydrogen and dark matter in nearby galaxies, star formation and galaxy evolution, and in large-scale structures of the Universe and the Zone of Avoidance. The most recent expansion includes cosmic magnetism and Big Data.\\n\\nThe department is also\\xa0an integral part of the Research Centre in Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravitation (**[www.acgc.uct.ac.za](http://www.acgc.uct.ac.za)**) established in 2009. Its primary goal is to form a major research hub in astrophysics, cosmology and gravity in southern Africa, with particular emphasis on projects involving the new facilities SALT and MeerKAT that will require the expertise from both observers and theorists. The Centre provides a natural home for the students and staff of NASSP, the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (**[www.star.ac.za](http://www.star.ac.za)**).\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n**[www.ast.uct.ac.za](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

It provides a high-level, quality learning experience for all its students, from undergraduate to postgraduate, in both theoretical and practical aspects of chemistry. It has no fewer than four recipients of the UCT Distinguished Teacher award on its current teaching staff. Two members of its academic staff have been awarded prestigious research chairs under the South African Research Chair Initiative. The Department has active research groups with strengths in Catalysis, Bioinorganic, Biophysical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Synthetic Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Supramolecular Chemistry, Scientific Computing and Chemical Glycobiology.\\n\\nChemistry is a popular study choice at UCT as graduates are directly employable and the postgraduate degrees are in demand in industry. The versatility of the chemistry qualification is borne out by the fact that\\xa0graduates find employment in such diverse fields as energy (fossil fuels), agrochemicals, mining and minerals, pharmaceutical and medicinal (biotechnology, drug production, and vaccines), polymers (plastics), food (quality control, and wine and beer-making), and computational chemistry.\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n**[www.chemistry.uct.ac.za](http://www.chemistry.uct.ac.za/)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

Understanding the impact of our oceans on the atmosphere and ultimately climate change is central to many of the research interests of staff in the department. Emphasis is on the physical environment in the oceans and atmosphere and their interactions. The main focus of the department is on teaching and research in physical oceanography, atmospheric science and climatology in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa.\\n\\nThe Department has research groupings in sea-going observations, satellite marine remote sensing, marine biogeochemistry, the Southern Ocean, the Agulhas Current system and South West Indian Ocean, the Benguela upwelling system, coastal oceanography, numerical modelling, the science underpinning operational oceanography, marine and coastal meteorology, severe weather, and climate change and variability. It hosts the Nansen-Tutu Centre for Marine Environmental Research, the international French-RSA ICEMASA collaboration, and a DST/NRF Chair in coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling.\\xa0\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at** **[sea.uct.ac.za](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-oceanography)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

The department is located in the Faculty of Science but has strong ties to the Faculty of Commerce.\\xa0\\n\\nThe department is committed to the development of the statistical sciences within and beyond the university. In its teaching, the department recognises that there are needs both to train professionals in the statistical sciences, and to provide quantitative and decision-making skills to students in other disciplines. In its research, the department seeks to maintain a balance between the development of theory and applications of that theory. In broad terms, the research within the department covers mathematical statistics, operations research and decision modelling, biostatistics, ecology, finance and econometrics. The research conducted by the department is a blend of both theory and applications.\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n**[www.stats.uct.ac.za](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

As a Faculty within Africa’s top research-led university, we are home to many world-ranked researchers, and located in a geographic region that offers many unique opportunities for innovative research.\\n\\nWe offer a wide range of postgraduate study programmes designed to build the intellectual and technical capacity of our students to find creative solutions for the challenges facing society or pursue interests in fundamental scientific enquiry. Conceptual and practical training prepares our graduates for leadership in research, policy, and decision-making, equipping them for a wide range of professional and academic career paths both in and beyond South Africa.\\n\\nBecome part of the many innovative and dynamic teams that perform cutting-edge research on:\\n\\n- African climate change and sustainable development.\\n- The international SKA radio telescope project.\\n- Chemical and molecular research aimed at the fight against diseases prevalent in Africa.\\n- Exciting marine biology and oceanography programmes focusing on coastal waters, the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean.\\n- The Large Hadron Collider’s particle physics projects, working with the international consortium at CERN.\\n- Investigating the internationally famous Western Cape Floral Kingdom.\\n- Computer science and ICT for development.\\n\\n#### Degrees Offered\\n\\nA summary of the postgraduate qualifications offered can be found [**here**](https://uct.ac.za/postgraduate-hub/courses/courses-faculty). For more information on individual degrees, their associated rules and admission requirements, refer to the [**Faculty Handbook**](https://www.uct.ac.za/students/study-uct-handbooks/handbooks) **and** [**UCT’s General Rules and Policies**](https://www.uct.ac.za/students/study-uct-handbooks/handbooks).\\n\\nHonours Degree\\n\\nHonours is an intensive year-long program of advanced study within a particular discipline.\\n\\nA candidate entering an Honours degree must generally have a BSc degree in the appropriate discipline.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\nMasters Degree\\n\\nA candidate entering a Master’s degree must have a Bachelor of Science Honours degree or a four-year undergraduate equivalent (i.e. a four-year degree post-South African National Senior Certificate equivalent, which includes a research project).\\n\\nApplicants have a choice between a Master of Science (MSc) or a Master of Philosophy (MPhil). Both are offered as research-based or part coursework degrees, with the majority of students completing a research-based Master’s degree.\\n\\n##### Master of Science (MSc)\\n\\nThe research-based MSc requires the submission of a dissertation on a selected research topic, completed under the guidance of a supervisor.\\n\\nThe MSc by coursework and minor dissertation is a degree in which a candidate completes part of the requirement through coursework, and the other by way of a minor dissertation on a piece of supervised research. The dissertation is smaller in scope.\\n\\n##### Master of Philosophy (MPhil)\\n\\nThis is either a research degree, or a degree obtained by coursework and minor dissertation, for candidates engaged in cross-faculty research dissertations or where a candidate comes from a non-science academic background.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\\n\\nThis is a research degree that requires a candidate to be able to conduct independent research on their own initiative. Through the thesis, the candidate must be able to demonstrate that they are at the academic forefront in the topic selected, that the work is original and that it advances knowledge in the field.\\n\\nApplicants for a PhD must have a Master’s degree.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\n## \\n\\n#### Funding\\n\\nThe University has a dedicated Postgraduate Funding Office responsible for the management and administration of postgraduate awards, scholarships, fellowships, and bursaries. With an extensive database, it informs students of available funding opportunities, assists with applications, and lobbies for additional funding. Further information on funding for postgraduate students can be found [**here**](http://www.students.uct.ac.za/students/fees-funding/postgraduate-degree-funding/applications-requirements).\\n\\nAdditional funding for Master and PhD students is available via supervisor research grants, and a limited number are provided by the Science Faculty. The latter are managed via applications that are made with the support of an applicant’s intended supervisor.\\n\\n*Last updated 15 Jan 2024*\\n\\nSCIENCE FACULTY MASTERS EQUITY FELLOWSHIP\\n\\n[**Masters study**](/sites/default/files/media/documents/2026-science-faculty-masters-equity-scholarship-application-form.docx)\\n\\nSCIENCE FACULTY DOCTORAL EQUITY FELLOWSHIP\\n\\n[**PhD study**](/sites/default/files/media/documents/2026-science-faculty-doctoral-equity-scholarship-application-form.docx)\\n\\nCall for applications for SCIENCE FACULTY PhD FELLOWSHIPS\\n\\n[**PhD Fellowships**](/sites/default/files/media/documents/2026-science-faculty-phd-fellowship-application-form.docx)\\n\\nUSEFUL LINKS\\n\\n[Science Faculty and Other University Handbooks](https://www.uct.ac.za/students/study-uct-handbooks/handbooks)\\n\\n[Postgraduate Hub](https://www.uct.ac.za/postgraduate-hub)\\n\\n[Postgraduate Funding](https://uct.ac.za/students/fees-funding-postgraduate-degree-funding/postgraduate-degree-funding-overview)\\n\\n[Postgraduate Applications](https://uct.ac.za/students/applications-apply-postgraduate-qualifications/applications-and-registration)\\n\\n[Academic Calendar](https://uct.ac.za/staff/academic-calendar)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**CONTACT DETAILS**\\n\\n[sci-postgrad@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-postgrad@uct.ac.za)\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

[Home](/)\\n\\n# Astronomy\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/Ska.jpg)\\n\\nThe Department of Astronomy at the University of Cape Town was established in 1972. It is the only dedicated university-based astronomy group in the country. Since its launch it has strong ties - and also joint positions - with the South African Astronomical Observatory (**[www.saao.ac.za](http://www.saao.ac.za)**) making regular use of the telescopes, including the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in Sutherland. In recent years equally strong interactions have been established by\\xa0growing the radio group with the South African SKA Office due to its strong involvement (and lead) in four of the ten MeerKAT large survey projects . The department specialises in high speed photometry and spectroscopy of variable stars, in long period variable stars and Galactic Structure, neutral \\xa0hydrogen and dark matter in nearby galaxies, star formation and galaxy evolution, and in large-scale structures of the Universe and the Zone of Avoidance. The most recent expansion includes cosmic magnetism and Big Data.\\n\\nThe department is also\\xa0an integral part of the Research Centre in Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravitation (**[www.acgc.uct.ac.za](http://www.acgc.uct.ac.za)**) established in 2009. Its primary goal is to form a major research hub in astrophysics, cosmology and gravity in southern Africa, with particular emphasis on projects involving the new facilities SALT and MeerKAT that will require the expertise from both observers and theorists. The Centre provides a natural home for the students and staff of NASSP, the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (**[www.star.ac.za](http://www.star.ac.za)**).\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n**[www.ast.uct.ac.za](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

The department is located in the Faculty of Science but has strong ties to the Faculty of Commerce.\\xa0\\n\\nThe department is committed to the development of the statistical sciences within and beyond the university. In its teaching, the department recognises that there are needs both to train professionals in the statistical sciences, and to provide quantitative and decision-making skills to students in other disciplines. In its research, the department seeks to maintain a balance between the development of theory and applications of that theory. In broad terms, the research within the department covers mathematical statistics, operations research and decision modelling, biostatistics, ecology, finance and econometrics. The research conducted by the department is a blend of both theory and applications.\\n\\n![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/mouse-20.png)\\n\\n**For more information visit the department\\'s website at**  \\n**[www.stats.uct.ac.za](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

TERMS OF REFERENCE: 8.1 The Higher Education Act, 1997 (section 37) provides that the Council may with the approval of Senate, “determine the minimum requirements for admission to study” and “refuse readmission to a student who fails to satisfy such minimum requirements for admission”. 8.2 The Faculty Readmission Appeal Committee considers appeals against refusals to readmit students, within the following policy guidelines laid down by Senate and Council: 8.2.1 Each programme must have uniform minimum progression requirements for all students; 8.2.2 The Readmission Appeal Committee must consider the student’s circumstances and full academic record and establish that a student has a reasonable prospect of academic success within the N+1 time frame1, or find exceptional circumstances2 before allowing a readmission on appeal; 8.2.3 The Committee considers and deals with appeals from students who are refused readmission by the Faculty Examinations Committee (FEC) or Faculty Board sitting as a FEC, on the basis that the first time a student fails to meet the readmission requirements, the FEC will have granted a concession (FECR code) to continue on probation and with support, and that when the student again fails to meet the readmission requirements, the FEC will not grant a concession again, but deny them permission to reregister (RENN code). Note: Where a student previously coded FECR has pending DE or SUPP results that will determine whether or not they meet the readmission requirements, they will be coded SUPP and invited to appeal. (The FEC will decide whether they are RENN or not once the results are known.) 8.3 Appeals are heard only on the written submissions and document(s) submitted and there is no right to an oral presentation. 8.4 No member of a Faculty Examinations Committee (or Faculty Board acting as a FEC) may be a member of the Readmission Appeal Committee hearing an appeal against its decision. 8.5 The Readmission Appeal Committee for the Faculty must assess whether the student has a reasonable prospect of success of achieving the qualification within the N+1 timeframe (to be confirmed by an advisor or a faculty manager) and that they have measures in place to mitigate the challenges which led to the poor academic performance. 8.6 If the student wishes to transfer to another faculty, in addition to the criteria in 8.5, the student must have met the published requirements for transferring students (this is to be confirmed by the Faculty Manager). _________________________ 1 N+1 – this is the total time in an undergraduate career, and where a student has transferred between programmes, includes the time enrolled for all programmes 2 Exceptional circumstances could for example be: having less than a full academic year load to complete, or having in the past transferred in ‘good standing’ and not previously having been excluded which necessitates and longer overall time. 9. PROCEDURES: 9.1 A student must submit their appeal in a specified format as indicated in the RAC information pack by the specified date. 9.2 The service request will be assigned to the Readmission Appeal Committee in the relevant Faculty. A copy of a transcript is accessible on PeopleSoft if this has not been included with the appeal. 9.3 The Faculty Servicing Officer will indicate what the student’s N status is to facilitate the RACs decision making. 9.4 The Servicing Officer of the RAC may obtain the necessary information from the Undergraduate Funding Office and make it available to the members of the RAC. 9.5 The Readmission Appeal Committee should apply the following general principles in the consideration of appeals: 9.5.1 The overall academic performance of the student in the current as well as in previous years of study. 9.5.2 The reasons provided as an explanation for poor performance. 9.5.3 The remedial steps taken to improve performance. These steps would include seeking the assistance of the relevant university structures or services which, inter alia, provides career guidance, counselling, and social services to students. 9.5.4 If specific circumstances (including personal and financial factors as well as accommodation problems), are cited as an explanation for poor performance, the student must provide proof that steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of these circumstances from negatively influencing their studies in future. 9.5.5 Should illness and/or a mental condition be cited as an explanation for poor performance the student must provide proof that the condition no longer exists or is being managed and that his or her future performance will not be affected by the condition. 9.5.6 The measure of compliance with the progress requirements set by the faculty in cases where a student was previously conditionally readmitted by the faculty. 9.5.7 The Committee must be convinced that a student possesses the required ability, resources, and physical health to complete the degree they have enrolled for within a reasonable period. Note: • Except for finalists, the RAC does not have discretion to readmit students where the evidence shows that the student can no longer complete in N+2. • Where necessary, an electronic ballot of voting members will be held in deciding the outcome. 9.6 The faculty is entitled to verify the documents or proof submitted, if required. 9.7 The onus rests on the student to provide all the required and relevant information and supporting documents. In the absence of complete supporting documentation, the Committee will make a decision based on what is presented before them. 9.8 Deans are responsible for ensuring that programme conveners or curriculum advisors are available in the time students need them to complete their appeal forms and to provide the Readmission Appeal Committees with any information that may be required to decide on whether the student meets the criterion listed above. 9.9 The RAC must provide reasons for all its decisions. If the RAC decides to readmit and allow the student to reregister, there must be a motivation which includes a plan of how the student can complete. 9.10 The Readmission Appeal Committee must submit a report, including a statistical report, on the appeals lodged and how it has dealt with these, after each cycle to the Dean of the CHED whose responsibility it will be to review policy, to review the application of the policy, and to report to the Senate Executive Committee on the readmissions process in each cycle. The report should cover issues of student advice, curriculum approval and teaching. 9.11 The RAC may stipulate that any student it allows to be readmitted be: 9.11.1 required to report for counselling by the Student Wellness Services; and/or 9.11.2 require that they attend academic support interventions. 9.12 The annual report by the Committee to the Chair of the Faculty Board is a vehicle for accounting for the work of the Committee. Because of this the Committee must: 9.12.1 report on what it has achieved RELATIVE TO the agreed goals and objectives of the Committee and to its agreed purpose. 9.12.2 hold itself accountable in that its report places the parent committee chair in the position to judge how well the Committee has performed. 10. DELEGATED AUTHORITY: The Readmission Appeal Committee acts in terms of authority delegated by Council and Senate. There is no appeal against decisions of the Readmission Appeal Committee. A student may, however, ask the Vice-Chancellor, or the Vice-Chancellor’s nominee, to review the decision of a Readmission Appeal Committee. The Vice-Chancellor, or nominee, may after reviewing a case, set aside the decision and refer it back to the RAC for fresh consideration, or substitute with his or her own decision.

[Home](/)\\n\\n# Undergraduate\\n\\n![Chris Hani Building](/sites/default/files/media/images/science_uct_ac_za/chris_hani_building.jpg)\\n\\nThe Faculty of Science is able to offer you a unique and enriching undergraduate experience, and a qualification that is respected throughout the world. As a Faculty within Africa’s top ranked university, we are home to many world-ranked researchers, and you will be taught by leaders in their fields. You will join over 2000 undergraduate students registered for the Bachelor of Science degree.\\n\\nWe offer a wide range of majors designed to build the intellectual and technical capacity of our graduates so you can critically engage in, and find creative solutions for, the challenges facing society, or\\xa0subsequently pursue postgraduate studies at this or any university around the world. The conceptual and practical training offered will prepare you for leadership in research, policy and decision-making and equip you for a wide range of professional and academic career paths in and beyond South Africa, and to be able to compete competitively in the international arena. Over 15% of our undergraduate students and 35% of our staff are international, which will provide you with a multi-cultural experience and exposure to a variety of perspectives that will shape your future.\\n\\n##### Degrees Offered\\n\\nBachelor of Science (BSc)\\n\\nThe BSc degree provides a graduate with the specific discipline knowledge, together with a range of related skills, essential for the workplace, or to allow continuation to postgraduate study. Curricula are designed to provide adequate foundations and depth in the chosen majors, but also to attain generic skills such as numeracy, problem solving, and computer and communication skills which are necessary to function as a graduate.\\n\\nBasic structure of the BSc:\\n\\n- A minimum of 3 years to complete.\\n- 2 majors are selected. Students may include a major from another faculty.\\n- 9 full year courses or the equivalent in half courses are completed over the degree period.\\n  - Typically, 4 or 5 courses are taken at first-year level, 2 or 3 at second-year level and 2 at third-year level.\\n  - Courses comprise a mixture of lectures, tutorials, practicals and field work.\\n  - Unlike school, it is not necessary to do all first-year courses during the first year at university.\\n  - Courses include compulsory ones required for each major, as well as elective ones (which are not prescribed but chosen out of interest to fulfil the degree requirement of completing nine full courses).\\n  - All students are required to do a mathematics course. For some majors, a statistics course is also required.\\n\\nDetails of the courses required for each major can be found in the [**Faculty Handbook**](https://uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/media/documents/uct_ac_za/49/science-handbook-11-2025.pdf).\\n\\nClosed\\n\\nBSc Extended Option\\n\\nStudies in the mathematical and scientific disciplines are challenging. Many students find the transition from school to university difficult – the quantity of work, the pace at which material is covered and conceptual complexity are all greater than at school, even though some of the topics covered appear similar.\\n\\nOur experience shows that many first-year students can overcome this difficult transition by spreading their curriculum over a four-year period, thus giving themselves sufficient time to understand and master the challenging material. To help students perform optimally, many first-year courses have two options:\\n\\n- 1 year option.\\n- 1.5- or 2-years option, with extra support offered.\\n\\nStudents who choose a 4-year curriculum currently qualify for an extra year of NSFAS funding.\\n\\nAll students write a set of **formal class tests after four weeks of lectures.** Using the marks achieved in these tests, together with the results of the school-leaving examinations and the National Benchmark Tests (NBTs), each student is guided on the best plan for their degree.\\n\\nThe Faculty provides individual consultations with [**Student Advisors**](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-current-undergraduate-students/student-advisors), who are lecturers with experience in assisting students to plan a curriculum that gives them the best chance of fulfilling their potential in their chosen majors.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\n## \\n\\n*Last updated 15 January 2025*\\n\\n#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\n[Faculty Handbook](https://uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/media/documents/uct_ac_za/49/science-handbook-11-2025.pdf)\\n\\n[Undergraduate Funding Opportunities](https://www.uct.ac.za/dsa/student-funding-administration-financial-assistance/overview)\\n\\n[2025 Fees and payment dates](https://uct.ac.za/media/625082/ \"Fees and payment dates\")\\n\\n#### STUDY SCIENCE\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-05.png)](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)\\n\\n**[Archaeology](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-06.png)](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)\\n\\n**[Astronomy](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-07.png)](/sci/departments/study-biology)\\n\\n**[Biological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-08.png)](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)\\n\\n**[Chemistry](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-09.png)](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)\\n\\n**[Computer Science](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-12.png)](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)\\n\\n**[Environmental and Geographical Science](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-10.png)](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)\\n\\n**[Geological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-11.png)](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)\\n\\n**[Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-13.png)](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)\\n\\n**[Molecular and Cell Biology](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-14.png)](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)\\n\\n**[Oceanography](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-15.png)](/sci/departments/study-physics)\\n\\n**[Physics](/sci/departments/study-physics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-16.png)](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)\\n\\n**[Statistical Sciences](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.

[Home](/)\\n\\n# Undergraduate\\n\\n![Chris Hani Building](/sites/default/files/media/images/science_uct_ac_za/chris_hani_building.jpg)\\n\\nThe Faculty of Science is able to offer you a unique and enriching undergraduate experience, and a qualification that is respected throughout the world. As a Faculty within Africa’s top ranked university, we are home to many world-ranked researchers, and you will be taught by leaders in their fields. You will join over 2000 undergraduate students registered for the Bachelor of Science degree.\\n\\nWe offer a wide range of majors designed to build the intellectual and technical capacity of our graduates so you can critically engage in, and find creative solutions for, the challenges facing society, or\\xa0subsequently pursue postgraduate studies at this or any university around the world. The conceptual and practical training offered will prepare you for leadership in research, policy and decision-making and equip you for a wide range of professional and academic career paths in and beyond South Africa, and to be able to compete competitively in the international arena. Over 15% of our undergraduate students and 35% of our staff are international, which will provide you with a multi-cultural experience and exposure to a variety of perspectives that will shape your future.\\n\\n##### Degrees Offered\\n\\nBachelor of Science (BSc)\\n\\nThe BSc degree provides a graduate with the specific discipline knowledge, together with a range of related skills, essential for the workplace, or to allow continuation to postgraduate study. Curricula are designed to provide adequate foundations and depth in the chosen majors, but also to attain generic skills such as numeracy, problem solving, and computer and communication skills which are necessary to function as a graduate.\\n\\nBasic structure of the BSc:\\n\\n- A minimum of 3 years to complete.\\n- 2 majors are selected. Students may include a major from another faculty.\\n- 9 full year courses or the equivalent in half courses are completed over the degree period.\\n  - Typically, 4 or 5 courses are taken at first-year level, 2 or 3 at second-year level and 2 at third-year level.\\n  - Courses comprise a mixture of lectures, tutorials, practicals and field work.\\n  - Unlike school, it is not necessary to do all first-year courses during the first year at university.\\n  - Courses include compulsory ones required for each major, as well as elective ones (which are not prescribed but chosen out of interest to fulfil the degree requirement of completing nine full courses).\\n  - All students are required to do a mathematics course. For some majors, a statistics course is also required.\\n\\nDetails of the courses required for each major can be found in the [**Faculty Handbook**](https://uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/media/documents/uct_ac_za/49/science-handbook-11-2025.pdf).\\n\\nClosed\\n\\nBSc Extended Option\\n\\nStudies in the mathematical and scientific disciplines are challenging. Many students find the transition from school to university difficult – the quantity of work, the pace at which material is covered and conceptual complexity are all greater than at school, even though some of the topics covered appear similar.\\n\\nOur experience shows that many first-year students can overcome this difficult transition by spreading their curriculum over a four-year period, thus giving themselves sufficient time to understand and master the challenging material. To help students perform optimally, many first-year courses have two options:\\n\\n- 1 year option.\\n- 1.5- or 2-years option, with extra support offered.\\n\\nStudents who choose a 4-year curriculum currently qualify for an extra year of NSFAS funding.\\n\\nAll students write a set of **formal class tests after four weeks of lectures.** Using the marks achieved in these tests, together with the results of the school-leaving examinations and the National Benchmark Tests (NBTs), each student is guided on the best plan for their degree.\\n\\nThe Faculty provides individual consultations with [**Student Advisors**](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-current-undergraduate-students/student-advisors), who are lecturers with experience in assisting students to plan a curriculum that gives them the best chance of fulfilling their potential in their chosen majors.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\n## \\n\\n*Last updated 15 January 2025*\\n\\n#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\n[Faculty Handbook](https://uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/media/documents/uct_ac_za/49/science-handbook-11-2025.pdf)\\n\\n[Undergraduate Funding Opportunities](https://www.uct.ac.za/dsa/student-funding-administration-financial-assistance/overview)\\n\\n[2025 Fees and payment dates](https://uct.ac.za/media/625082/ \"Fees and payment dates\")\\n\\n#### STUDY SCIENCE\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-05.png)](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)\\n\\n**[Archaeology](/sci/departments/study-archaeology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-06.png)](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)\\n\\n**[Astronomy](/sci/departments/study-astronomy)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-07.png)](/sci/departments/study-biology)\\n\\n**[Biological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-08.png)](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)\\n\\n**[Chemistry](/sci/departments/study-chemistry)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-09.png)](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)\\n\\n**[Computer Science](/sci/departments/study-computer-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-12.png)](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)\\n\\n**[Environmental and Geographical Science](/sci/departments/study-environmental-geographical-science)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-10.png)](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)\\n\\n**[Geological Sciences](/sci/departments/study-geological-sciences)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-11.png)](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)\\n\\n**[Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](/sci/departments/study/mathematics-applied-mathematics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-13.png)](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)\\n\\n**[Molecular and Cell Biology](/sci/departments/study-molecular-cell-biology)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-14.png)](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)\\n\\n**[Oceanography](/sci/departments/study-oceanography)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-15.png)](/sci/departments/study-physics)\\n\\n**[Physics](/sci/departments/study-physics)**\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/content_migration/science_uct_ac_za/60/images/science-icon-16.png)](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)\\n\\n**[Statistical Sciences](/sci/departments/study-statistical-sciences)**\\n\\n[![Faculty of Science logo](/themes/custom/blip_uct/logo.svg)](https://uct.ac.za \"Home\")\\n\\n**Tel:** 021 650 2712  \\n**Email:**\\xa0**[sci-science@uct.ac.za](mailto:sci-science@uct.ac.za)**\\n\\n**Physical address**  \\nLevel 6, Chris Hani Building, University Avenue,  \\nUpper Campus,\\xa0  \\nUniversity of Cape Town,\\xa0  \\nRondebosch\\n\\n- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/UCTScienceFaculty/)\\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCTscience)\\n- [Custom](https://www.instagram.com/scienceuct/)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/107309949)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uctfacultyofscience2496)\\n\\n- [Graduation](https://science.uct.ac.za/graduation)\\n- [International Students](https://science.uct.ac.za/undergraduate-studies-undergraduate-applicants/international-students)\\n\\nCopyright © - 2025 - University of Cape Town - All rights reserved.
